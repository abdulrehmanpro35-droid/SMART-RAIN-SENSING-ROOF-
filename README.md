The Smart Rain Sensing Roof is an Arduino-based automatic system designed to protect clothes and open areas from unexpected rainfall. The system uses a rain sensor to continuously monitor weather conditions; when rain is detected, the Arduino processes the signal and automatically activates a motor mechanism to close the roof. LED indicators provide real-time status of the system, making it easy to understand whether the roof is open or closed. This project reduces manual effort, saves time, and prevents damage caused by sudden rain. The Smart Rain Sensing Roof is cost-effective, reliable, and suitable for homes, hostels, and outdoor drying areas, demonstrating the practical use of automation and embedded systems.
